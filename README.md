This project delves into the realm of AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE), focusing on multimodal pretraining for software user interfaces (UIs) that integrates both textual and visual elements. Building upon this text-image backbone, the framework facilitates a variety of downstream tasks, including but not limited to UI captioning, UI retrieval, and UI localization.

A notable innovation of this work is the integration of Grad-CAM with the multimodal model, enabling text-guided localization. This approach enhances our understanding and interpretation of how specific UI elements are associated with textual descriptions, paving the way for more intuitive and interactive software engineering applications.
